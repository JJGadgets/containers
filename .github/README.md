Hey there, @JJGadgets here.

A big portion (most if not all, minus _maybe_ some changes for my own taste) of the pipeline code found here was originally made by @onedr0p and @bjw-s from the Kubernetes@Home community.

While it would be possible to rewrite a simplified version of this, I decided it was more efficient to use the battle tested pipeline code, which was made available and licensed as open source, cherry-pick changes from upstream (onedr0p's [containers]<https://github.com/onedr0p/containers> repo) back into my repo, and where it seems fit, contribute back any fixes or features or whatnot. Effectively, a hivemind.

This makes it easier to focus on actually building containers instead of worrying about the pipeline code to build and maintain said containers all by myself.

As of 2023-12-01, the CODEOWNERS file in this folder (.github) will contain @onedr0p, @bjw-s and myself, to effectively reflect all the people who have contributed to the pipeline code found in this repo.
Only if a technical reason arises where the CODEOWNERS file shouldn't contain these amazing people, will it be changed to only reflect myself, and this README will be the main source of attribution from me.
